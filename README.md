## CryptoClustering

Within this module, I learned how to cluster crytp currency using two methods of unsupervised learning. These methods and techniques are demonstrated below:

* Prepare the data, using Standard Scaler to normalize the numeric data within price change fields
* Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
* Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
* Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
* Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
